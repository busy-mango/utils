# Busymango/utils

The utils library exported as a [ESM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) module.

## Installation

`pnpm add @busymango/utils@latest`

## Why not lodash
Lodash and Underscore are great modern JavaScript utility libraries, and they are widely used by Front-end developers. However, when you are targeting modern browsers, you may find out that there are many methods which are already supported natively thanks to ECMAScript5 [ES5] and ECMAScript2015 [ES6]. If you want your project to require fewer dependencies, and you know your target browser clearly, then you may not need Lodash/Underscore.

## Why use this?

The library are great for:
 * Iterating arrays, objects, & strings
 * Manipulating & testing values
 * Creating composite functions
 * Friendly typescript
